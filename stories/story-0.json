    "Student, the hardest part of journaling is simply choosing to begin.",
    "Give yourself five minutes, a quiet corner, and one honest line.",
    "Try three prompts: what happened, how you felt, what it means.",
    "Write freely firstâ€”edit later if you must.",
    "End with gratitude or one small intention for tomorrow.",
    "With each page, you train your memory to notice what matters.",
    "Start tonight. Write one line, and share your first entry in the comments to reflect on what you learn."
